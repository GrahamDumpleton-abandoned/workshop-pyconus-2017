## Using Web Console

In addition to being able to run commands using the command line client,
many operations can also be triggered from the web console. The web console
also provides a more visual way of seeing information about what
applications are deployed.

In your web browser where you previously logged into the web console,
return to the project overview page of the project you created, or go
to the URL:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}/console/project/project-userXX/overview
----

After having added the application to the project, you should now see in
the project overview page:

From here you can access various details of the application you created, or
using options in the left hand side bar, browse to details on any resources
that have been created in the project. You can also access build logs, as
well as logs for the running application.

To view log files, select on **Applications** and then **Pods** from the
left hand side bar.

The list of running instances of your application, as well as completed
builds will be listed.

Click on the entry for the instance of the running application and select
the **Logs** tab to see the logs for the application.

To view the logs for an instance of the running application from the
command line, you can use the `oc logs` command.

Select on the **Terminal** tab for an instance of the running application
and you can access the running container from an interactive command shell.

To obtain an interactive shell in an instance of the running application
from the command line, you can use the `oc rsh` command.
