## Adding Storage

By adding a separate PostgreSQL database server, the blog posts were
retained across a restart of the web application. The database was saved in
a persistent volume, so a restart of the database would also see the posts
being retained.

Not all the data a web application collects may be stored in a database
though.

Return to the blog site and edit an existing post. Upload an image to be
displayed with the post.

Once again, kill the running instance of the web application so it is
restarted, by running:

[source]
----
oc delete pod --selector app=blog
----

Refresh the blog post with the image and you will see that the image that
was uploaded can no longer be found, even though the record of the post
believed an image was attached.

This was because the image is not being stored in the database, but in a
directory in the file system. At this point that directory only exists
within the container, and so when the web application was restarted by
killing the container, the image was lost.

To ensure separate data such as images which are stored in the file system
are retained across restarts, it is necessary to mount a persistent volume
into the container for the web application.

You can claim a persistent volume and mount it into the web application
container at the directory where uploaded images are being stored, by
running the command:

[source]
----
oc set volume dc/blog --add --name=blog-images -t pvc --claim-name=blog-images --claim-size=1G -m /opt/app-root/src/media
----

This will output:

[source]
----
persistentvolumeclaims/blog-images
deploymentconfig "blog" updated
----

As this was a change to the deployment configuration, the web application
will be automatically restarted.

Edit the post again and clear the link for the broken image and upload an
image again. Delete the pod for the web application again by running:

[source]
----
oc delete pod --selector app=blog
----

and the image should this time still be present after the restart.

You can see what persistent volumes you have claimed and which are associated
with your project by running:

[source]
----
oc get pvc
----

This should display output similar to:

[source]
----
NAME          STATUS    VOLUME    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
blog-db       Bound     pv0033    100Gi      RWO,ROX,RWX   3h
blog-images   Bound     pv0017    100Gi      RWO,ROX,RWX   2m
----

The output will show not only the persistent volume you just claimed to
store upload images, but also that previously created when the PostgreSQL
database was deployed.
