## Deploy PostgreSQL

In order to provide persistence to the SQLite database currently being
used, a persistent volume could be attached to the container the
application is running in and the SQLite database stored in it. For a
production system, it is preferable though to use a separate database
server product such as PostgreSQL.

In order to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL you will first need to deploy
an instance of a PostgreSQL database that can be used. Specifying that
PostgreSQL should be deployed, can done from the web console when adding a
new application to a project.

On the overview page of the web console, select _Add to project_ in the
top menu bar.

This will bring up the browser for the catalog of applications which you
can deploy.

Select on the _Datastores_ category. This should bring up a list of SQL
databases and NoSQL datastores that you can deploy.

Select on _PostgreSQL (Persistent)_. This will start the flow for deploying
an instance of the PostgreSQL database with persistent storage attached.

On this form, override the values for the following settings, using the
new values shown:

* *Database Service Name*: `blog-db`
* *PostgreSQL Connection Username*: `username`
* *PostgreSQL Connection Password*: `password`
* *PostgreSQL Database Name*: `blog`

If you do not supply a username and password then the values of those
fields will be automatically populated, but we want to fix the values to a
known value as we will use them later when configuring the web application
to use the database.

When you have updated the values of the four fields, click on _Create_
at the bottom of the form to start the deployment process. This will bring
up a page to confirm the details used.

Select on _Go to overview_ to watch as the deployment occurs. When the
deployment has completed, the overview page should show the web application
for the blog and the database.

Next you need to switch the web application to use the database you just
deployed.
