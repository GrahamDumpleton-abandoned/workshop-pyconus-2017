## Deploy PostgreSQL

In order to provide persistence to the SQLite database currently being
used, a persistent volume could be attached to the container the
application is running in and the SQLite database stored in it. For a
production system, it is preferable though to use a separate database
server product such as PostgreSQL.

In order to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL you will first need to deploy
an instance of a PostgreSQL database that can be used. Specifying that
PostgreSQL should be deployed, can done from the web console when adding a
new application to a project.

On the overview page of the web console, select _Add to project_ in the
top menu bar.

This will bring up the browser for the catalog of applications which you
can deploy.

Select on the _Datastores_ category. This should bring up a list of SQL
databases and NoSQL datastores that you can deploy.

Select on _PostgreSQL (Persistent)_. This will start the flow for deploying
an instance of the PostgreSQL database with persistent storage attached.
