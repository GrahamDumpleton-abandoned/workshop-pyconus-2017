## Deploy PostgreSQL

In order to provide persistence to the SQLite database currently being
used, a persistent volume could be attached to the container the
application is running in and the SQLite database stored in it. For a
production system, it is preferable though to use a separate database
server product such as PostgreSQL.

In order to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL you will first need to deploy
an instance of a PostgreSQL database that can be used. Specifying that
PostgreSQL should be deployed, can done from the web console when adding a
new application to a project.
