## Workshop Overview

In this workshop you will learn about deploying applications to OpenShift.

The workshop provides a set of hands on exercises for you to work through.
That is, you are provided with the instructions and work through them
yourself at your own pace. The instructor and any workshop assistants are
here simply to help you if you have any problems, or to answer any
questions you may have. The instructor will not be leading you through the
exercises. The workshop is run in this way to give you the maximum amount
of time possible to work with and experiment with OpenShift, rather than
wasting time waiting for the instructor to show you how to do things at
each step.

The sample application which will be used is a Python web application
implemented using the Django web framework. The web application implements
a simple blog site and is hosted using `mod_wsgi-express`.

The key exercises you will work through are as follows:

- Deploying from source code the Python web application. Initially this
  will use a self contained SQLite database with no persistence of data
  across restarts.

- Deploy a PostgreSQL database, link the Python web application up to
  the database and initialise the database. The PostgreSQL database will
  use a persistent volume for data storage so that contents of posts, which
  are stored in the database, are preserved across restarts of the
  database.

- Attach a persistent volume to the Python web application for storage of
  images uploaded with posts, and stored in the local filesystem, so that
  they are preserved across restarts of the web application.

You can start working through the exercises as soon as you are ready and
there is no need to wait for the instructor.
