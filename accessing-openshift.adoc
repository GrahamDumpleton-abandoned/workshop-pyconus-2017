## Accessing OpenShift

OpenShift is a multi tenant system capable of supporting multiple users at
the same time. To do anything within an OpenShift environment you must
first login. Once you have access, before you can deploy any application,
you must also have a project to deploy it into.

In this set of exercises you will login into the OpenShift environment and
create a project to work in.

### Logging in from the command line

In order to login using the `oc` command line client, run the command:

[source]
----
$ oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
----

You may see the following output:

[source]
----
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n):
----

The reason you received this message is because the OpenShift environment
being used for this workshop is using a self-signed certificate. In a
real-world scenario, either OpenShift's certificate would be signed by a
standard CA (eg: Thawte, Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a
corporate-standard CA that you already have installed on your system.

Respond with `Y` to accept the use of the self signed certificate and
continue.

[NOTE]
====
On some versions of Microsoft Windows, you may get an error that the server
has an invalid x.509 certificate. If you receive this error, use the
following command instead:

[source]
----
$ oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}} --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----
====

Once you issue the `oc login` command, you will be prompted for the
user name and password combination for your assigned user account:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
Username: userXX
Password: pyconus2017
----

When you have been authenticated successfully, you will see the following
confirmation message:

[source]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----

### Creating a new project

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An
OpenShift project allows a community of users (or a single user) to
organise and manage their content in isolation from other communities.

Each project can have its own resources, policies (who can or cannot
perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc).

Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and
endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

Before you can deploy the Python web application used in this workshop, you
need to create a new project in which to deploy it. As you are working in a
shared OpenShift environment, you need to use a unique name for your
project. Create a new project which incorporates your user name by running:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
$ oc new-project project-userXX
----

You should see the following message to confirm the creation of the project.

[source]
----
Now using project "project-userXX" on server "https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
----

### Logging into the web console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform
various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web console works,
open your browser and go to the following URL:

*link:https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}[]*

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter in the
following credentials:

[source]
----
Username: {{USER_NAME}}
Password: {{USER_PASSWORD}}
----

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. You will see
something that looks like the following image:

image::explore-webconsole1.png[Web Console]

Click on the *{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}* project. When you click on the
*{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}* project, you will be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's nothing there now, but that's about to
change.

{% if METRICS_ENABLED %}

Lastly, the web console will show you an error: _An error occurred getting
metrics._  We need to accept another self-signed certificate for OpenShift's metrics
aggregation. If we don't, then the metrics will not display in the OpenShift UI.

Click the link that says *Open metrics URL*, and accept the certificate.

{% endif %}

We will be using a mix of command line tooling and the web console for the labs.
Get ready!
