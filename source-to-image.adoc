## Source-to-Image (S2I)

OpenShift provides different options for building and deploying application
containers. These include:

- *Build and deploy from application source code* - Users can specify
  the location of their application source code in a Git repository.
  OpenShift will build the application using steps appropriate for the
  programming language and software stack being used, then build a
  container image that includes the application and deploys it. Users can
  instead supply a `Dockerfile` as the source for instructions to build the
  container image. OpenShift will build the container image from the
  `Dockerfile`, within OpenShift, and deploy it.

- *Build and deploy from application binaries* - Users can specify
  the location of their application binaries, generated from their existing
  application build process and tools. OpenShift will build the container
  image that includes the supplied application binaries and deploy it.

- *Deploy an existing container image* - Users can build the application
  and container image completely outside of OpenShift, using existing
  application and container image build processes and tools, or use an
  existing container image supplied by a third party. OpenShift will pull
  down the nominated image and deploy it.

In this workshop you will deploy a Python web application from application
source code hosted in a Git repository hosted by GitHub. The processing of
building the container image from the application source code is
facilitated using a tool provided by the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)]
project.

The S2I project is described as:

"Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible
Docker images from source code. S2I produces ready-to-run images by
injecting source code into a Docker container and letting the container
prepare that source code for execution. By creating self-assembling builder
images, you can version and control your build environments exactly like
you use Docker images to version your runtime environments."

Visually the process can be depicted as:

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this workshop, but you can
find more information about it in the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[S2I project repository].

The key concept to understand about S2I is that it takes your application
source code and creates from it a container image which can then be
deployed, without you needing to know the specifics of how to construct the
image.

S2I can be compared to cartridges from OpenShift 2 (prior version of
OpenShift), or buildpacks from Heroku and Cloud Foundry. The difference
compared to older systems such as buildpacks, is that S2I has been purpose
built for creating container images using Docker and OCI image formats.
