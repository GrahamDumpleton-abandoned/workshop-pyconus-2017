## Expose Application

At this point, although the Python web application has been deployed, it
isn't yet accessible. This is because the steps used to create it from the
command line did not expose it automatically outside of the OpenShift
environment.

In order to expose the application externally as a HTTP service, it is
necessary to create a route which maps a public URL to the application.

This is done as a separate step as you don't always want an application to
be automatically available. You may for example be deploying microservices
which should only be visible to the front end web application running in
the same environment.

The creation of a route and making the application visible outside of the
OpenShift environment can be done from the command line or the web console.
This time we will use the web console.

### Creating the route

From the project overview page, select the **Create Route** link displayed
top right of the summary details for the application.

This will bring up a page for entering the details of the route to be
created and which will expose the application outside of the OpenShift
environment as a HTTP service.

From this page you can set various details including the hostname to use in
the URL and whether to use a secure connection.

For this workshop use the default settings and create the route. This will
result in the application being exposed over a HTTP connection, with a
generated hostname which is a sub domain of that for the OpenShift
environment.

Click on the URL for the application which is now displayed on the project
overview page to visit the web application.
