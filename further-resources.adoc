## Further Resources

In this workshop you

- Deployed from source code the Python web application. Initially this
  used a self contained SQLite database with no persistence of data across
  restarts.

- Deployed a PostgreSQL database, linked the Python web application up to
  the database and initialise the database. The PostgreSQL database used
  a persistent volume for data storage so that contents of posts, which are
  stored in the database, are preserved across restarts of the database.

- Attached a persistent volume to the Python web application for storage of
  images uploaded with posts, so that they are preserved across restarts of
  the web application.

The exercices show how OpenShift can be used not only for deploying
stateless web applications, but also applications require persistent file
system storage.

This flexibility makes OpenShift an ideal platform for deploying both web
applications and databases.

Below you will find further resources so you can continue learning about,
or experiment with OpenShift.
