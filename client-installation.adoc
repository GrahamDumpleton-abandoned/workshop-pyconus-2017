## Client Installation

To deploy applications to OpenShift and manage them, OpenShift provides a
feature rich web console, as well as a command line tool. The OpenShift
command line client is a single executable called `oc`, written in the Go
programming language. The command line client is available for the
following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Apple OS X
- Linux

This workshop will be using both the web console and command line client.
You therefore need to download the command line client and install it,
such that it can be found on the executable search path of your command
shell.

### Downloading the client archive

Download the package archive containing the client for your operating
system using the following links:

- {{DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_WINDOWS}}[Microsoft Windows]
- {{DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_MACOSX}}[Apple OS X]
- {{DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_LINUX_64BIT}}[Linux (64 Bit)]
- {{DOWNLOAD_CLIENT_LINUX_32BIT}}[Linux (32 Bit)]

It is suggested you place the archive in the following directory:

**Windows:**

[source]
----
C:\OpenShift
----

**OS X:**

[source]
----
~/OpenShift
----

**Linux:**

[source]
----
~/OpenShift
----

This can also be used as the location of the `oc` executable when extracted
from the package archive.

### Extracting the command line client

To extract the package archive containing the client, do the following:

**Windows:**

To extract the zip archive on Windows, you will need a zip utility
installed on your system. With newer versions of Windows (greater than XP),
this is provided by the operating system. Right click on the downloaded
file using __File Explorer__ and select the menu option to extract the
contents.

**OS X:**

Open up a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded
the file. Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

[source]
----
$ unzip openshift-origin-client-tools-{{OC_CLIENT_VERSION}}-mac.zip
----

**Linux:**

Open up a terminal window and change to the directory where you downloaded
the file. Once you are in the directory, enter in the following command:

[source]
----
$ tar --strip-components 1 -xvzf openshift-origin-client-tools-{{OC_CLIENT_VERSION}}-linux-64bit.tar.gz
----

The result should be that you can see the `oc` executable file located in
the directory where you are extracting the package archive.

### Updating executable search path

To add the directory containing the `oc` executable file to your executable
search path, do the following:

**Windows:**

The exact steps to add a new directory to the executable search path on
Windows can vary depending on the version of Windows being run.

For Windows 10, right click on your computer name inside of the __File
Explorer__. Select __Advanced System Settings__. Click on the __Advanced
Tab__, and then finally click on __Environment Variables__. From the
dialog window, select the __Path__ variable and add `;C:\OpenShift` at the
end. The modification will apply to any new terminal window created.

If using __PowerShell__, you could also temporarily modify the executable
search path for the current terminal window by running:

[source]
----
$Env:Path += ";C:\OpenShift"
----

Rather than updating the excutable search path, you could always just copy
it to the `C:\Windows` directory, or other directory you know is already on
your path.

For instructions on how to edit the executable search path on older
versions of Windows see:

- http://www.itechtics.com/customize-windows-environment-variables/[Windows 8]

**OS X:**

For OS X you can temporarily modify the executable search path for the
current terminal window by running:

[source]
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/OpenShift
----

Alternatively add this line to `~/.bash_profile` and it will apply for any
new terminal window created.

**Linux:**

For Linux you can temporarily modify the executable search path for the
current terminal window by running:

[source]
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/OpenShift
----

Alternatively add this line to `~/.bash_profile` and it will apply for any
new terminal window created.

### Verifying the command line client

At this point, the `oc` executable should be found in your executable
search path and ready to use. Test that the executable can be found and
runs by running:

[source]
----
$ oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[source]
----
{{OC_VERSION}}
----

If you get an error message indicating that the `oc` program cannot be
found, you have not updated your path correctly.

If you get a different version for `oc` being displayed, ensure you don't
have an older version of the `oc` executable somewhere else in your
executable search path. It is recommended that you use the same version as
the version of OpenShift being used for this workshop.

If you are having problems ask the instructor or workshop assistants for
help.
