## Deploy Application

OpenShift provides different options for building and deploying application
containers. These include:

- *Build and deploy from application source code* - Users can specify
  the location of their application source code in a Git repository.
  OpenShift will build the application using steps appropriate for the
  programming language and software stack being used, then build a
  container image that includes the application and deploys it. Users can
  instead supply a `Dockerfile` as the source for instructions to build the
  container image. OpenShift will build the container image from the
  `Dockerfile`, within OpenShift, and deploy it.

- *Build and deploy from application binaries* - Users can specify
  the location of their application binaries, generated from their existing
  application build process and tools. OpenShift will build the container
  image that includes the supplied application binaries and deploy it.

- *Deploy an existing container image* - Users can build the application
  and container image completely outside of OpenShift, using existing
  application and container image build processes and tools, or use an
  existing container image supplied by a third party. OpenShift will pull
  down the nominated image and deploy it.

In this exercise you will deploy a Python web application from application
source code hosted in a Git repository hosted by GitHub.

### Source-to-Image (S2I)

The processing of building the container image from the application source
code is facilitated using a tool provided by the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[Source-to-Image (S2I)] project.

The goal of the S2I tool is described as:

"Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images.
S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting source code into a
Docker image and assembling a new Docker image which incorporates the
builder image and built source. The result is then ready to use with
docker run."

Visually the process can be depicted as:

OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special __Pod__, called a build
pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling,
and other aspects of OpenShift.

A full discussion of S2I is beyond the scope of this workshop, but you can
find more information about it in the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/s2i.html[OpenShift S2I documentation]
or the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[S2I project repository].
The only key concept you need to remember about S2I is that it's magic.
