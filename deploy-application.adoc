## Deploy Application

OpenShift provides different options for building and deploying application
containers. These include:

- *Build and deploy from application source code* - Users can specify
  the location of their application source code in a Git repository.
  OpenShift will build the application using steps appropriate for the
  programming language and software stack being used, then build a
  container image that includes the application and deploys it. Users can
  instead supply a `Dockerfile` as the source for instructions to build the
  container image. OpenShift will build the container image from the
  `Dockerfile`, within OpenShift, and deploy it.

- *Build and deploy from application binaries* - Users can specify
  the location of their application binaries, generated from their existing
  application build process and tools. OpenShift will build the container
  image that includes the supplied application binaries and deploy it.

- *Deploy an existing container image* - Users can build the application
  and container image completely outside of OpenShift, using existing
  application and container image build processes and tools, or use an
  existing container image supplied by a third party. OpenShift will pull
  down the nominated image and deploy it.

In this exercise you will deploy a Python web application from its
application soyrce code in a Git repository.
